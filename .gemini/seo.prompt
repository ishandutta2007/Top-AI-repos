it is still not much optimised for SEO, on https://github.com/ishandutta2007/<repo>/graphs/traffic tab I don't see much of google.com or bing.com or gemini.com or chatgpt.com or perplexity.ai or deepseek.com among referring sites list. Please alter the readme so that it gets indexed by atleast one of these sites, if the readme has too many generic keywords that makes it hard then try to use tail querries or keywords focused on sub niches in this space.
